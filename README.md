# iOS Icon Template

I know that many icon templates already exist out there, but I wanted something simple and clean, and a PSD using [Photoshop's Generator feature](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/generate-assets-layers.html).

With this PSD, you'll be able to automatically generate an assets folder, containing all your image files (in retina and non-retina), named in a proper way to be used directly with Xcode or on your website/webapp.

Don't hesitate to [ping me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/skynebula) if you have any question...
